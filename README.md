# PyConfigComposer
by Richard McAllister


This is a tool that was originally meant to save ME from making some of the mistakes that I was in the habit of making when creating json configuration files.  I rely on them a lot.  But I believe the problem of complex configurations is one that is common and a good general solution is certainly in demand.  There MAY be better ways of creating complex configurations.  But for now, if you need to keep people in line when they're creating configurations for your simple tools...you may be in the right place.
